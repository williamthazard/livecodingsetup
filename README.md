# live coding setup
basic setup for live coding
<br><br>
hopefully this can provide a useful, easily extensible starting place

note that this is looking for a folder called "samples" that is located in the same place as the .scd file. A folder with that name will need to be present in that place in order for this thing to work. I've added that folder to this repo; just make sure to copy that to the same location as the .scd file prior to running it. Then, you can swap out the samples however you wish!
<br><br>
please note, too, that the synth voices used here take the form of classes. That means you'll need to add the four .sc files in the classes folder (also included in this repo) to your SuperCollider extensions folder. If you don't know where to find that folder, just go to file > open user support directory in SuperCollider, and it'll open the correct folder for you. Add the .sc files there.
