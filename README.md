# live coding setup
basic setup for live coding
<br><br>
hopefully this can provide a useful, easily extensible starting place

note that this is looking for a folder called "samples" that is located in the same place as the .scd file. A folder with that name will need to be present in that place in order for this thing to work. I've added that folder to this repo; just make sure to copy that to the same location as the .scd file prior to running it. Then, you can swap out the samples however you wish!
